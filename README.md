## Label-aggregation

This repo implements a basic Bayesian model for aggregating labels from multiple annotators in a way that takes annotator biases (and optionally vigilance) into account. The method is described in more detail in the appendix of "Detecting Stance in Media on Global Warming" by Yiwei Luo, Dallas Card, and Dan Jurafsky [https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.296](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.findings-emnlp.296)
